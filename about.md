My name is Adam Bujak, and I'm a third year mechatronics student at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. I'm passionate about embedded software and electronics. I'm eager to further my skills and I work to improve through my current internship and various personal projects.

I'm currently located in San Francisco, and working at Whisper AI on an exciting new hearing system.

In my spare time I like to hang out with friends, play soccer, snowboard, and work on my personal projects.

Please excuse the sloppy USB port in the image above, I forgot to order a USB C port so I had to improvise with a little super glue, micro USB port, and some magnet wire.
