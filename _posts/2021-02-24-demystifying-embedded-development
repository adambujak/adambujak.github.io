# Introduction 

There's a bit of a learning curve to move from developing high level software to developing embedded code on something like an Arduino or a BeagleBone. I found the learning curve of moving from Arduino to a more professional microcontroller (the nRF52832 in my case) to be much more troublesome. I hope to make this a bit easier for you. 

I'm assuming you're familiar with basic C, and the very basics of Arduino (GPIO, ADC, etc.)

# Getting Started

Once you know how to program your microcontroller, it all makes sense (duh,) but when I was getting started with my nRF52DK I was so confused by all the things that were available to download. There's an SDK, the nRF Programming Tools, the JLink Software, SEGGER Embedded Studio, it was very overwhelming.
